# M-Red Function (Maximum Real Expression Defined)

The **M-Red Function (Mred)** is a mathematical concept designed to express the **largest possible finite real number** that can be defined using a **limited number of characters**.

---

## 🧠 Formal Definition
**Mred(N)** = max { value(E) | E is a mathematical expression with at most **N↑N** characters, and **E ∈ ℝ** }.

This defines the upper bound of expressible real numbers within a syntactic limit, inspired by the logic of **Busy Beaver** and **fast-growing functions**, but formulated in terms of *expression length* rather than computation.
